npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the System
Visit: `http://localhost:5173` and create a new page with:
```tsx
import { ModerationDemo } from './pages/ModerationDemo';
// Add to your routes
```

## 📈 **Usage Examples**

### Simple Integration
```tsx
import { useModeration } from './hooks/useModeration';

const { moderateCampaign, result, loading } = useModeration({
  onApprove: (result) => createCampaign(result),
  onReject: (result) => showErrors(result.requiredEdits)
});

await moderateCampaign(campaignData, creatorInfo);
```

### Advanced Dashboard
```tsx
import { ModerationDashboard } from './components';

function AdminPage() {
  return <ModerationDashboard />;
}
```
